# To-do-list

To-do list app where each to do looks like a post it note, and each post it note goes onto a notice board. 

I created this app to understand how to work with the DOM better in JS and  have a way to remeber things to do.

And I specifically chose this look because I thought it was more styllistic than the average to-do app consequently, making the post it's and the pop up feature improved my knowledge of CSS.
