# To-do-list

To-do list app where each to do looks like a post it note, and each post it note goes onto a notice board.

I chose this look because it was more styllistic than a modern to-do list, To make the post it's and the pop up feature took a lot of learning CSS.

Also, I wanted to create this app to understand how to work with the DOM better in JS and  have a way to remeber things to do.
